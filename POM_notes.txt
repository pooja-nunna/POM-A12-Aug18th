A Page Object Model (POM) in Selenium is a design pattern where each web page of an application is represented as a
 separate class, containing methods to interact with its web elements, essentially creating an
 object repository that improves code reusability and makes test maintenance easier by centralizing
 UI element interactions and reducing code duplication when changes occur on the web page;
 this allows for cleaner, more modular test scripts where each page is treated as an object with
 defined actions to perform on it.

Key points about POM:
    Organization:
        Each web page is represented as a class with methods for interacting with its elements,
        like clicking buttons or entering text.
    Maintainability:
        If UI changes occur, modifications are only needed in the corresponding page object class,
        not across multiple test scripts.
    Code Reusability:
        Common actions across pages can be defined in base classes and inherited by specific page objects.
    Readability:
        Test scripts become clearer by explicitly calling methods that represent actions on a page.
    Locator Management:
        Web element locators are stored within the object repository, making it easier to manage and update
        them if needed.

Benefits of using POM:
    Reduced code duplication:
        By centralizing web element interactions, the same code doesn't need to be written repeatedly across different tests.
    Improved test maintenance:
        Changes to the UI only require updates in the relevant page object class, not across all test scripts.
    Enhanced code readability:
        Test logic is easier to understand as each page is represented by a dedicated class with clear methods.

Data-Driven Testing (DDT) is a software testing methodology where test input and
output values are read from external data sources (like Excel, text file, CSV, JSON, or databases),
rather than being hard-coded into the test scripts.

Why Use DDT?
Easier maintenance: Update only the data file, not the test logic.
Reusability: Same test method reused with various inputs.
Scalability: Ideal for regression testing and large test suites.

FRAMEWORK

In Selenium, a framework refers to a structured combination of tools and design patterns that helps in
designing, organizing, and maintaining test scripts efficiently

Why use a framework in Selenium?
    To increase code reusability
    To improve maintainability and scalability
    To enhance test reporting
    To manage test data efficiently
    To support cross-browser

What is Generic components in Automation Framework?
	it’s one of the automation framework components which is common for all the application
	its collection of generic modules contains reusable methods / libraries
    The methods which can be used to any application is called Generic/common methods
 	 It is used to store all the generic modules


What is the advantages of Generic components?
	Reusability of code
	Code Optimization
	Test script development is faster
	Test Code readability
	Generic libraries are common to all automation projects
	Avoid duplicate Code
	no need to remember the syntax every time , just create once & use multiple times.



1.	What is Object/Elements/POM Repository
    Its collection of elements locators & business libraries in one place & its developed using POM design pattern


2.	Why Object repository ?
    An Object Repository (OR) is a centralized storage location where you store all your web elements (locators) that your automation script interacts with

3.	What is the advantages repository?
    a.	Reusability of elements, no need to write xpath & other locators again & again
    b.	Modification in Repository is easy, when GUI changes frequently
    c.	Maintenance is easy, because all the elements we kept in one place
    d.	Test Script Code Optimized via business reusable libraries
    e.	More Readability
    f.	Test Script development is faster due to business lib


4.	What is POM?
    POM stands for Page Object Model.
    It is a design pattern used in Selenium automation testing to enhance code maintainability, reusability, and readability.

5.	Why POM ?
    It’s a well-organized structured design pattern, where we can maintain all the web elements in page wise, due to POM design pattern maintains & modification is easy & faster.
